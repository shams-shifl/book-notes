# Notebook for read books

#### This is a simple site that shows all the books recently read by someone. It shows the book cover image, title, author, when it was finished reading, rating gave by the reader and a summary note. This project is built as a part of Capstone Project under Web Development Bootcamp. 

## How to Install
1. Start by ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies
2. Create a database with following columns
    * id
    * title
    * isbn
    * author
    * readAt
    * rating
    * note
3. Replace the database information in the ```index.js ``` file
4. Run the database
5. Start the server by ```npm start```

## Dependencies
To run the project you need npm installed. I have also used ejs to build the site's UI. ExpressJS is used for the backend framework.
